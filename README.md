# Indie Game Lounge

Welcome to **Indie Game Lounge**, an open-source collection of interactive web-based games built to entertain, educate, and inspire. This repository hosts a variety of indie-style games, including puzzle solvers, classic party games, and more. It's perfect for casual players, developers looking to learn from code, or anyone wanting to contribute to fun projects.

Whether you're generating mazes, playing traditional number games, or exploring algorithmic challenges, Indie Game Lounge offers something for everyone. Built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, all games run directly in the browser.

## Games Included

- **Maze Generator and Solver**: Create customizable mazes and watch algorithms like Dijkstra's find the shortest path. Ideal for learning graph theory and pathfinding.
- **Tambola (Housie/Bingo)**: A digital take on the classic number-calling game, also known as Indian Bingo. Generate tickets, call numbers, and claim prizes like Full House, Top Line, or Four Corners. Supports multiple players and variants for added fun[11][15].
- **Future Expansions**: Plans to add more games like A* pathfinding demos, trivia challenges, and multiplayer modes. Suggestions welcome!

## Key Features

- **Browser-Based Play**: No installations needed – just open and enjoy.
- **Customization Options**: Adjust game settings, such as maze sizes, colors, or Tambola ticket counts.
- **Educational Value**: Dive into the code to understand algorithms, random generation, and game logic.
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for playing without internet.

## Technologies

- **Core Stack**: JavaScript for logic, HTML/CSS for interfaces, and npm for dependencies.
- **Algorithms**: Implements Dijkstra's for mazes; random number generation for Tambola.
- **Variants Available**: Check branches for Python implementations or experimental features.
