# Indie Game Lounge

**Indie Game Lounge** is a static web application designed as an interactive platform for exploring graph theory, traversal algorithms, and path-finding techniques through fun, engaging indie-style games. Currently featuring a maze generator and solver, it serves as a learning tool and playground for developers and enthusiasts interested in algorithms and game development ðŸŽ¯.

## Features

- **Progressive Web App (PWA) Support**: Install and play offline on any device for a seamless experience.
- **Customizable Maze Creation**: Generate mazes of various sizes and colors to suit your preferences.
- **Path-Finding Algorithms**: Solve mazes using Dijkstra's algorithm, with plans to add more algorithms like A* and BFS in future updates.

## Technologies Used

This application is built with JavaScript (using npm for package management). If you're a Python enthusiast, a Python version is also available for experimentationâ€”check the repository branches or related projects for details.
